## on the project -

- In this project, I create a Todo List Web Application,

  in which the user can store prioritized _todo tasks_ and view/sort that list,

  and do more things on the tasks and on the list.

  Here is a preview sample of the functionality:

![Add todo task and mark as done](./readme-files/first.gif)

## how to use

- Enter your task to do in the input area.

- Select the end date for the task.

- Select the priority of the task.

- and click on "add" button.

## More features that can be used in the app

**Search button**

- With the help of the button you can search for certain letters or words from the tasks

  and thus access a specific task.

**Edit button**

- With this button you can re-edit the name / text of your tasks

  even after you have already added them to the list

- **example:**

![search and edit buttons](./readme-files/searchAndEdit.gif)

**Drag'n'drop**

- This feature allows you to drag any task to another place on the list

  by clicking on the task and dragging to the desired location

- **example:**

**Delete button**

- With the help of the button you can delete unwanted tasks

  or tasks that have already been performed

**Undo action**

  you can click the button and change the theme

**Help button**

- If you are getting tangled up with the app the button may be able to give you an initial answer

- **example:**

- Until the page loads, a loading spinner will appear to

  illustrate that the site is indeed in the process of loading

**test**

- I write a new test to my web application.

- The test check if ◊êhe delete button actually deletes a task from the list,

  -and whether the new array is saved Without the deleted value.
